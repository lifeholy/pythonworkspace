Introduction
************
Scratch EXE Creator is yet another way to turn one of your Scratch projects into an EXE, with one new, 
revolutionary feature: it can put the project back into the EXE after you've saved it! This is helpful with any 
project where you can save your progress. It's also made completely in batch script (with NSIS to make the EXE).

Installation
************
Just copy the Scratch EXE Creator folder from the zip to a location of your choice. It's that SIMPL (hint hint ;) ).

Features
********
he ability to save the project's state back into the EXE
he option to completely control what and how dialogs show up
he option to specify a custom icon
nd a simple, text-based interface (with lots of options :P)

Use
***
First, copy your project into the Scratch EXE Creator folder and rename it to project.sb. If you want a custom icon,
move your icon into the Scratch EXE Creator folder and rename it to icon.ico. Then, run CreateScratchEXE.bat, fill
out all the fields, and press Enter at the conformation prompt if you're satisfied with everything (or type in some 
garbage, it doesn't care :P). If all goes well, your new EXE will show up in the directory.

If it crashes when you enter in something in the field, you probably used a quotation mark ("). Just re-run the 
batch file and don't use a quotation mark.

If you're still having trouble, ask for help at the Scratch EXE Creator forum thread on Scratch here:

Special thanks goes to nXIII, who helped me with the Scratch image a bit.

Enjoy!
